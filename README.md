# ðŸ‘¾ Retro Space Invaders - Video Game




<h2>Description</h2>
This is a 2D arcade-style space shooter game developed in Python using Pygame. The player controls a battleship that must survive wave after wave of enemy ships, collecting power-ups and dodging enemy fire. The game features a scrolling background, high score tracking, power-ups, and two-player mode,  all wrapped in a pixel-art-inspired retro design.

<h2>Languages and Tools Used</h2>

- <b>Python</b> (Pygame framework)
- <b>Pygame</b> for game logic, animation, and collision detection
- <b>Pixel Art Generator</b> for custom retro button graphics

<h2>Development Environment</h2>

- <b>Python 3.x</b>
- <b>Pygame 2.x</b>
- <b>VS Code</b> for development and debugging

<h2>ðŸŽ® Program Walk-Through</h2>

This project is a retro-style 2D space shooter game built with Python and Pygame. It features scrolling backgrounds, enemy waves, power-ups, laser combat, score tracking, and multiple game modes (including two-player support). Here's a breakdown of the core mechanics and visuals:

---

### 1. Game Structure & Decomposition

The game is modularly designed with clear decomposition:
- **Player**: Movement, shooting, health tracking
- **Enemies**: Spawning, movement patterns, collision detection
- **Lasers**: Both player and enemy lasers with hit detection
- **Menus**: Main, pause, and options
- **Power-ups**: Timed collectibles affecting gameplay
- **Game modes**: Randomised behaviours for enemy waves

###  2. Main Menu and Navigation Flow

The game begins with a retro-inspired main menu allowing the player to:
- Start single or two-player mode
- View controls
- Toggle settings or exit

Menus are consistent in styling and flow for smooth navigation.

###  3. Player & Enemy Mechanics

- The player ship moves with WASD and shoots projectiles using the spacebar.
- Enemies spawn randomly or in grid formations depending on the game mode.
- Collision logic removes ships on impact and updates health/status bars.

### 4. Scrolling Background & Immersion

A continuously moving background image simulates space traversal and boosts immersion.

### 5. Power-Ups and Collisions

- Power-ups randomly appear and must be collected before expiring.
- Different effects can be added (e.g., laser upgrades or temporary invincibility).

### 6. High Scores and Game Progression

- A high-score tracker updates when a new wave is surpassed.
- Difficulty increases with each wave via faster enemies or denser attack patterns.

### 7. Two Player Mode

- Fully implemented second player with unique controls and health tracking.
- Victory is determined when one ship survives longer than the other.

### 8. Testing and Reliability

The game has been rigorously tested across:
- Menu navigation
- Collision detection
- Player/enemy mechanics
- Power-up logic
- Game mode switching
- High-score tracking

Test cases ensure that every core mechanic functions as expected throughout different playthroughs.
